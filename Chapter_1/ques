# ✅ **50 QUESTIONS FROM LEVEL 1 MACHINE LEARNING**

### **Basics of ML**

1. What is the difference between a model and an algorithm in ML?
2. Why does ML need training data?
3. What does it mean when we say a model “learns a pattern”?
4. What is the main goal of machine learning?
5. Why can’t ML rely on if-else rules for everything?

### **Model + Parameters**

6. What are parameters in an ML model?
7. Why do models need parameters?
8. What happens if a model has no parameters?
9. Are parameters fixed or learned during training?
10. What does “internal settings of a model” mean?

### **Intercept**

11. What is the intercept in a simple ML model?
12. Why is the intercept rarely zero in real-world problems?
13. Does the intercept represent the “start” of a line? Why/why not?
14. How does a model decide the value of the intercept?
15. Why is the intercept important for making realistic predictions?

### **Slope / Feature Effect**

16. What does the slope represent in a linear model?
17. How does slope affect prediction changes?
18. Can a model have multiple slopes? In what situations?
19. If slope is zero, what does the model predict?
20. What does a negative slope mean?

### **Learning Algorithm**

21. What is the purpose of a learning algorithm?
22. Do we create learning algorithms in normal ML work?
23. Name some common learning algorithms (non-DL).
24. What does it mean that the algorithm “adjusts parameters”?
25. Why can a model not adjust parameters by itself?

### **Training**

26. What is training in machine learning?
27. Why does training require repetition?
28. What happens if training is too short?
29. What happens if training is too long?
30. Why does training reduce prediction errors?

### **Predictions**

31. What does it mean to make a prediction?
32. Why must models generalize to unseen data?
33. What happens if a model memorizes training data?
34. What kind of prediction errors might a simple model make?
35. How do parameters influence prediction accuracy?

### **Real-World Understanding**

36. Give an example of a baseline value in real life (intercept).
37. Why do relationships in real life rarely pass through (0,0)?
38. Why does a taxi fare model need an intercept?
39. Why does predicting salary need an intercept?
40. Why does predicting room rent need an intercept?

### **ML vs Normal Programming**

41. How is ML different from traditional rule-based programming?
42. Why do ML systems not need manually coded rules?
43. In what case would rule-based logic still be better than ML?
44. Why does ML fail if the training data is wrong?
45. Can ML replace all traditional coding? Why/why not?

### **Misconceptions & Clarifications**

46. Why is intercept not the “starting point” of the line?
47. Why is input = 0 NOT equal to output = 0 in ML?
48. Why do beginners confuse model parameters with algorithm parameters?
49. Why is it important to distinguish model vs algorithm?
50. What happens if a model has an intercept but no slope?
